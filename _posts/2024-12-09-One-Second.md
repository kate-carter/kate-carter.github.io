## Abstract
Pathological altruism is a phenomenon that has long puzzled researchers, from biologists
observing alarm calling in rodents to neuroscientists studying heroic rescuers. It describes
actions taken by an individual that benefit the well-being of another at the expense of the
altruistic individual. While many behaviors fall under this common definition,
understanding the root causes and motivations for these actions requires consideration on
multiple time scales. The form of pathological altruism discussed in this paper is that of
acute, definitive acts that benefit another at a great risk or expense to the altruist. As the
contexts for these acts vary, so do the neurological correlates and immediate motivations.
However, the overarching commonality between all populations investigated is increased
amygdala activation in response to others’ distress. The networks activated around this
central thread vary based on the circumstances of the act, but the amygdala is always an
important player.

## Introduction
A man jumps in front of a bus to save a child who’s run into the road. A match for a
stranger’s kidney donates despite knowing the health risks. These acts of altruism come
with great risk and potential cost to the altruist with seemingly little payout. Defining
altruistic behavior as an action or actions that benefit the welfare of others, pathological
altruism can be defined by adding the condition that the altruistic act comes at the expense
of the altruist. 

Some behaviors that seem to fall under this definition are observed in the animal
kingdom. Worker bees do not reproduce and spend their entire lives tending to their
queen and the hive. Female prairie dogs will alarm call when an aerial predator is detected,
decreasing their chance of survival but increasing the survival of other colony members.
On closer inspection, none of these acts are truly “altruistic”. They all benefit the altruist in line with the selfish gene hypothesis (Ågren, 2016) All workers in a hive were born to the
queen, and serving her allows the genes of the hive to be passed down. The prairie dog
alarm callers are primarily adult, reproductive females: calling to protect the colony
protects the subset of the colony that is the progeny or relatives of the caller. These are not
acts of altruism, just social behavior that directly benefits the passage of genetic material,
not the personal well-being of the altruist.

Humans have been observed to perform acts of costly kindness for people who are
not their kin, however, making pathological altruism a uniquely human social behavior. An
act of altruism does not fall under kin selection or the selfish gene hypothesis unless it
directly benefits the passage of the altruist’s genes, including through relatives like siblings
and cousins who possess a percentage of the original individual's genetic code. This
distinction puts human altruism in a different category: “true” altruism, or altruism that
does not directly benefit the individual or their genes.

There are two categories of pathological altruism observed in humans: chronic and
acute. Chronic altruism occurs in situations of long, repetitive behaviors that hurt the
altruist. Examples of this are parents who forgo vaccines for their children because the
child is distressed by needles, and partners who enable substance abuse rather than
administer tough love and force the one they love to get help (Sapolsky, pg. 346). Acute
altruism occurs when someone performs a single costly, risky, or otherwise
self-destructive action to help another, usually a stranger or someone genetically unrelated
to them. This second type is what this paper focuses on.

The studies that form the basis of this paper focus on several populations that have
exhibited pathologically altruistic behaviors. Each describes their subjects a little
differently. The first is Carnegie Hero Award Winners. A study by Dr. David Rand
investigated 51 extreme altruists who had received the CHA. All of these individuals were
civilians who had voluntarily risked death or extreme injury to save the life of another
person. One of the requirements for this award is that the civilian needed to have no
connection or responsibility for the safety of the victim prior to the rescue, ruling out kin
selection (“Carnegie Hero Fund Commission”, 2024). A second study by Rhoads in 2023 studied 6 populations of extraordinary altruists, including non-directed kidney donors,
marrow donors, and humanitarian aid workers who had committed acts of extraordinary
altruism. These “acts” were very similar to those of the CHA recipients, except that the
person was not a civilian—usually an EMT or firefighter (Rhodes, 2023). Non-directed
kidney donors were also considered in Marsh, 2014 in an fMRI study comparing the brains
of pathological altruists, who show extreme levels of empathy, and psychopaths, who are
incapable of such empathy (Marsh 2014, Dolan 2009). The final population studied is
people who have not been documented to perform pathological altruism previously.
Behavioral and fMRI studies on adults centering around altruistic and pathologically
altruistic tasks have been performed parallel to those on subjects who have previously
demonstrated pathological altruism (Vekaria 2017, de Waal 2008, Marsh 2016). This was
used to investigate whether altruistic behaviors were more characteristic to individuals or
would be performed by anyone under the right circumstances.

There were unique qualities to each of the populations and analysis criteria for each
study based both on the people involved and the tasks they were assessed by. Because of
this, they can be used to paint a picture of the common threads involved in multiple types
of pathological altruism, but do not all report on the same things. Their findings have been
broken down into three sections to put together a cohesive understanding of the
motivations, cognitive processes, and neurological correlates that are involved in acute acts
of pathological altruism.

The Seconds section explores the neurological correlates that are activated during
acts of pathological altruism as well as the intuitive decision making common to
empathetic-concern based actions. Minutes to Hours delves into the social dynamics and
cognitive processes thought to motivate empathetic-concern and
relieving-personal-discomfort hypothesis actions. These factors play out in the immediate
situation the altruist finds themselves in before acting. Finally, the Months to Years section
looks at the differences in pathological altruist and control brains and the personality traits
commonly found in individuals who exhibit these behaviors.

## Seconds
There were found to be two types of decision making processes that motivated
pathological altruism, and one of them occurs in seconds. In interviews conducted with
Carnegie Hero Medal winners, many described their decision to step in as intuitive and
split-second. They saw someone in trouble. They were close enough to help. They helped.
The decision and their explanation of it held consistent even when they had time to reflect
before acting (Rand, 2014). This gut-instinct, intuitive decision making is indicative of
subcortical involvement. It is consistent with an earlier study on care-based altruism that
found that it was strongly connected to empathetic concern (Marsh, 2015).

Care based altruism, or altruism based in other-oriented concern, falls under the
"eliminating other’s distress” hypothesis. It’s aimed at improving the wellbeing of distressed
and vulnerable individuals, and is usually motivated by strong empathetic concern. The
brain regions activated when this type of altruism is performed includes structures dense
with receptors to oxytocin and vasopressin, including the amygdala, stria terminalis, and
striatum (Marsh, 2015). Another study on similar subjects found that the VTA, caudate, and
sgACC activated during other-oriented prosocial costly altruistic behaviors (FeldmanHall,
2015).

## Minutes to Hours
Pathological altruism is often situational, with the decision to help at cost to oneself
occurring within the context the altruist finds themselves in. However, not all altruistic
decisions are made intuitively in a split second. Several populations were investigated
through interviews and performance on research tasks to evaluate under what conditions
people would choose altruism.

Pathological altruists consistently demonstrated increased other-oriented concern
(FeldmanHall, 2015), (Rand, 2014), (Rhoads, 2023). This manifested in state distress
(FeldmanHall, 2015), automatic, intuitive decision-making (Rand, 2014), and increased
sensitivity to others’ fearful faces (Marsh et al, 2016). Behavioral studies investigated two
different cognitive mechanisms for understanding the motivation and enabling of costly
altruism. Individuals were thought to be motivated by either an egoist drive to eliminate
one’s distress when watching another in distress or other-oriented concern (FeldmanHall,
2015).

The relieving personal discomfort hypothesis is supported by de Waal 2008, which
studied empathetic altruistic motivation as derived from the “emotional stake it offers the
self in the other’s welfare” (de Waal, 2008) and FeldmanHall’s finding that pathological
altruism is motivated by state distress rather than trait distress (2015). State distress is a
situational feeling of discomfort, rather than trait distress, which is an engrained pattern of
emotional responses. Extreme altruists who acted out of their own self-interest were
motivated by the discomfort they felt in the moment, rather than having a history of
helping others to make themselves feel better.

The other-oriented concern hypothesis has been investigated in much more detail,
and was one of the main motivations for Carnegie Award Recipents. Also motivated by
state distress, their actions were governed by split-second, intuitive decision making.
However, altruistic decision making can occur over minutes to hours, rather than seconds.
The decision to donate an organ takes a little longer. A study focusing on kidney, marrow,
and liver donors found that they had an unusually high valuation of of other’s outcomes and
reduced personal distress (Rhoads, 2023). They also performed reduced social discounting
(Vekaria, 2017), which likely supports the higher value placed on other’s outcomes. While a
reduced concern for one’s own wellbeing combined with an increased value placed on the
wellbeing of others does not directly motivate altruistic behavior, this affective framework
explains the reasoning behind the decision to go forward with pathologically altruistic
actions. Importantly, these motivations were connected with other-oriented concern
consistent with the “relieving other’s discomfort” hypothesis, and not the “relieving
personal discomfort” hypothesis.

## Months to Years
There are some features that contribute to pathological altruism that act on a larger
time scale: neural plasticity and the development of personality traits. Neural circuits that
are activated more often tend to be more developed, and this is reflected in the size of the
activated brain region. One study focused on individuals who had donated a kidney to a
stranger, a costly altruism that cannot be explained by kin selection mechanisms. It
revealed that these individuals shared “enhanced volume in the right amygdala and
enhanced responsiveness of this structure to fearful facial expressions.” using fMRI imaging
of individuals while completing behavioral tasks like the face-emotion paradigm (Marsh,
2016). This enlargement is not something that occurs overnight, but rather is an increase in
region size due to repeated, increased activation of the brain area, in responding to fearful
facial expressions among other things. This implies that an individual who has committed
pathological altruism in this manner would be more likely to make other prosocial,
empathetic-concern based decisions. Altruists relieving their own discomfort may be
motivated by state distress, but there’s neurological evidence that some empathy-driven
altruists have a pattern of similar amygdala activation.

While Marsh, 2015, was the only study to report on brain region size and not just
activation, amygdala activation during pathologically altruistic acts is the commonality held
through all of the neural imaging studies that cover this topic, indicating that it has a
special significance among the brain regions implicated. The amygdala is the brain’s
headquarters for quick, emotional responses, and lights up especially strongly in response
to percieved pain, fear, and anxiety. It has also been found to be enlarged in young mothers
soon after giving birth. The increased amygdala volume has been linked to higher attention
being paid to the infant’s emotional needs, especially relieving distress (Holz, 2021).

Assessed using the HEXACO personality test, pathological altruists also scored
higher for some personality traits than their control counterparts. Altruistic individuals
differed from controls in “traits and decision-making patterns indicating unusually high
valuation of others’ outcomes: high Honesty-Humility, reduced Social Discounting, and
reduced Personal Distress.” (Rhoads, 2023). These two traits were part of the
“Interpersonal Reactivity” index, and are thought to contribute to the motivation to commit
acts of costly altruism. The HEXACO test was administered to six populations of altruists:
liver, kidney, and marrow donors, civilian heroic rescuers, and humanitarian aid workers
who had performed a heroic rescue.

## Discussion
Studying acute acts of pathological altruism and the individuals that commit them
requires consideration for the situational context, personality, and history of behavior that
they stem from. Studies have been conducted to analyze the neurological correlates and
immediate motivations for pathological altruism in a variety of contexts, and some
commonalities have been identified. Amygdala activation is at the core of all neural
correlates that have been identified, across motivations and contexts. Pathological altruists
who act out of empathetic concern, or the “relieving others’ discomfort” hypothesis have
similar patterns of neurological activation as parental care, and extreme altruists show an
enlargement of the right amygdala and increased activation in response to fearful
expressions. Altruists acting with the “relieving personal discomfort” hypothesis are
motivated by situational, state distress rather than ingrained, trait distress.

These findings support the notion that altruistic decision making is incredibly
context dependent. Many aspects of the motivations and decision making are social and
situational, dependent on what’s going on around the altruist and the recipient. Some are
habitual, stemming from the lived experiences of the altruist that have shaped their
personality and brain chemistry. Others are situational, with social and intuitive
motivations occurring in context.

While the causality of pathological altruism has been explored through a cognitive
science approach in recent years, gaps in the literature still exist. To create a more
cohesive understanding of the neuroscience behind pathological altruism, conducting an
fMRI study on Carnegie Hero Award Recipients and organ donors would help fill in the
gaps. Comparing these two populations would shed light on the neurological correlates
involved in split-second, intuitive decision making of the heroes and the empathetic,
pro-social decision making governed by reduced social discounting and personal distress
found in non-directed organ donors. Evaluating both populations, as well as a control with
a task designed to stimulate either a snap-decision or an empathetic act similar in weight
to an organ donation while performing fMRI could identify whether there’s a difference in
the neural activation patterns found in each population or each type of decision. This
could begin to unify our understanding of the neurological correlates involved in
pathologically altruistic acts, or to separate out the different structures that are involved
with each process based on the context the act occurs within.
