# Project Hiatus until 8/10/2025 

Thank you for all the amazing questions and suggestions at ISGS10!! (If you weren’t at ISGS10 or want to see my talk or slides again, click [here](https://kate-carter.github.io/2025/06/23/ISGS10.html) to go to that post.)

The next steps I’m taking with this project (after I update Gemini 2.5 Results) will be to do two more analyses and then start searching for journals to submit to.  Before I go to pre-print, I have to: 
1.	Fix the manual timestamp errors in my original dataset using a list of corrections that has been provided to me by FAU (thank you, FAU). 
2.	Port my Gemini timestamps into ELAN for analysis rather than doing manual comparison using a spreadsheet. 
3.	Use step #2 to perform analysis and data visualization to show timestamp accuracy on a quantitative scale, rather than “TRUE” if the timestamp is within .1s of the manual and “FALSE” if it isn’t. This will allow me to assess any trends in accuracy/inaccuracy and report on time-stamping in a more nuanced, meaningful, and useful way to the RGR community.

BEFORE I get into all of that, however, I have to finish the last three credits of my Bachelor’s degree, which will occur on August 8th.  Before August 8t,h I will likely publish my Gemini 2.5 Results and make some adjustments to my Gemini 2.0 results, but no major project updates will come in timestamp analysis or preprint until late August, early September.
If you’d like to be emailed a link when my paper goes to preprint on arxiv, please email me at kxc750@case.edu to be added to the chain.
